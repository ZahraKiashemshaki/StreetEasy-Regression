# StreetEasy_3D_Regression

Overview

This project is focused on building a 3D regression model to predict rental prices in Manhattan using the manhattan.csv dataset. The data was analyzed using Python, and a 3D visualization of the model was created to explore the relationship between variables such as apartment size and building age with rent prices.

The dataset used for this analysis can be found here: StreetEasy Dataset - Manhattan

Project Features

3D Data Visualization: The project utilizes Matplotlibâ€™s plot_surface() to create a 3D plot representing the regression model.
Multiple Linear Regression: A model is trained using features like size_sqft (apartment size) and building_age_yrs (building age) to predict rent prices.
Data Processing: The project involves loading the CSV data, cleaning it, and splitting it into training and test datasets for the regression analysis

# StreetEasy_2D_regresssion
Overview

This project involves building a 2D regression model to predict rental prices in Manhattan using the manhattan.csv dataset. The analysis utilizes scatter plots to visualize the relationship between apartment size, building age, and rent prices, while also evaluating the model's performance through train and test scores.

The dataset used for this analysis can be found here: StreetEasy Dataset - Manhattan

Project Features

2D Scatter Plot Visualization: The project includes scatter plots to illustrate the relationship between the features (apartment size and building age) and the target variable (rent price).
Linear Regression Model: A linear regression model is trained to predict rental prices based on the size of the apartment and its building age.
Performance Evaluation: The model's effectiveness is measured using train and test scores, providing insights into its predictive capabilities.
