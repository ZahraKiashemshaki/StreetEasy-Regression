# StreetEasy_3D_Regression

Overview

This project is focused on building a 3D regression model to predict rental prices in Manhattan using the manhattan.csv dataset. The data was analyzed using Python, and a 3D visualization of the model was created to explore the relationship between variables such as apartment size and building age with rent prices.

The dataset used for this analysis can be found here: StreetEasy Dataset - Manhattan

Project Features

3D Data Visualization: The project utilizes Matplotlibâ€™s plot_surface() to create a 3D plot representing the regression model.
Multiple Linear Regression: A model is trained using features like size_sqft (apartment size) and building_age_yrs (building age) to predict rent prices.
Data Processing: The project involves loading the CSV data, cleaning it, and splitting it into training and test datasets for the regression analysis
